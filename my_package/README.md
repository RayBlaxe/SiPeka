# My Package

This directory, `my_package`, is intended to house Python modules related to the main project.

Currently, the primary functionality of the project, vehicle detection and counting, is implemented in `vehicle_detection.py` in the root directory.

This `my_package` directory and its subdirectories (`my_package/subpackage`) are placeholders and are not directly used by the `vehicle_detection.py` script at this time. They are structured to allow for future expansion of the project, where related utilities, configurations, or extended functionalities could be organized into modules within this package.

## Potential Future Use

-   **Utility Modules:** Common functions used across different parts of the project.
-   **Configuration Management:** Modules for loading and managing settings.
-   **Extended Features:** If the project grows, different components (e.g., data analysis, reporting) could be developed as modules here.

For now, please refer to the main `README.md` in the root directory for information about the core vehicle detection system.
