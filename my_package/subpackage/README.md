# My Subpackage

This directory, `my_package/subpackage`, is a placeholder for a potential sub-module within `my_package`.

Currently, the main vehicle detection and counting logic resides in `vehicle_detection.py` in the project's root directory. Neither `my_package` nor this `subpackage` is actively used by the core script.

This structure is in place to facilitate future organization if the project expands. For example, `subpackage` could contain:

-   Specialized algorithms for a particular aspect of `my_package`.
-   Implementations of specific interfaces defined in `my_package`.
-   More granular components of a larger feature set planned for `my_package`.

For information on the current project functionality, please see the main `README.md` in the root directory and the `README.md` in the `my_package` directory.
